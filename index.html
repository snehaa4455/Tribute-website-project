        Subhas Chandra Bose, (born Jan. 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa, India—died
        Aug. 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan [China]?), Indian revolutionary. Preparing
        in Britain for a career in the Indian civil service, he resigned his
        candidacy on hearing of nationalist turmoil back home. Sent by Mohandas
        K. Gandhi to organize in Bengal, he was deported and imprisoned several
        times. He favoured industrialization, which put him at odds with
        Gandhi’s economic thought, and, though he was elected president of
        the Indian National Congress in 1938 and 1939, without Gandhi’s support
        he felt bound to resign. He slipped out of India in 1941 and carried on
        his struggle against the British from Nazi Germany and later from
        Southeast Asia. In 1944 he invaded India from Burma (Myanmar) with a
        small army of Indian nationals and Japanese, but his army was soon
        forced to retreat. He fled Southeast Asia after the Japanese surrender
        in 1945 and died of burns suffered in a plane crash.
